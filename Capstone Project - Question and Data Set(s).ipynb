We also don't have that much data in terms of numbers. Harvard's dataset, on the other hand, is a bit old but might be of help to serve as additional material."

    "- I'm currently working at Hapinoy, a social enterprise which aims to provide more opportunities for _sari-sari_ stores by being their _katuwang_ or their partner. A lot might actually think that _sari-sari_ stores are just small time businesses but we want to shift this way thinking and empower them that they are _sari-sari_ stores and not just _sari-sari_ stores. There are a lot of ways on which we can help do this and what we're currently focusing on now is doing so through technology. With technology, a lot of possibilities actually opens up. And what I want to explore on is how we can efficiently extend credit to _sari-sari_ store owners, as well as their customers, given that there is very little to no data available on this market."
